# employee-form
I created this for a college course assignment. I used create-react-app in the command line to set up and run a React project. 
I learned:
basic naviation and routing using react-router-dom,
how to create new JavaScript/CSS/HTML folders and files, 
how to import and export, 
how to define components, add input fields, and how to create a submit button using  the render() method,
how to test the application,
how local storage works, how to use it, and how to inspect it in the browser, 
and how to commit changes to Github

How to use:
Open terminal, navigave to folder where you want files saved, in terminal: git clone and paste url to terminal.
Check to make sure it cloned.
Open same terminal and type npm start. 
React application will open in browser.
Input information and it saves underneath form.
